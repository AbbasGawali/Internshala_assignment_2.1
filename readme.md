Project Details:- 

A blog website that was previously created, it had been styled by me using css stylesheets, i had also used a little code of javascript for making the navigation possible in the mobile devices.

I had used the color comnination ideas from colourhunt.io . 

Challenges faced :- 

The navigation part was very much difficult, as it had taken a lot of time of mine to make it, after that i realized that it cannot be done with plain css, so i used a little part of javascript on it.
